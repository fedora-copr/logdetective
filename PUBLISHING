# Publishing new release

New releases must be published on PyPi, ideally through github action,
although manual release management is also permissible.
In all cases, make sure to follow rules of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

New releases should be created in two stages.

## Release patch workflow:

1. Create new branch with name indicating it contains new release, e.g. `release-v5.7.1`.
2. Increment version in pyproject.toml using `poetry version` command. Use appropriate rule.
3. Commit the change in pyproject.toml.
4. Push the change, open PR and wait for approval.

## Github workflow:

1. Open releases dialog in repo main page.
2. Click on "Draft new release" button.
3. Create new tag for your release, if there isn't one already.
   Tag must begin with character "v", e.g. `v5.7.1`.
4. Set name for your release to match the tag.
5. Generate release notes or supply them manually.
6. Upload build artefacts, at very least the wheel build.
7. Make sure that the release name matches the "version" field in pyproject.toml
8. Publish the release.
