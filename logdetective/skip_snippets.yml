# This file holds patterns you want to skip during log parsing.
# By default, no patterns are supplied.
# Patterns are to be specified as values of dictionary,
# with each key being a descriptive name of the pattern.
# Patterns themselves are evaluated as a regular expression.
# Make sure to avoid regular expressions that may be interpreted
# as yaml syntax.
# Example:

# contains_capital_a: "^.*A.*"
# starts_with_numeric: "^[0-9].*"
child_exit_code_zero: "Child return code was: 0"
